This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.14.


this project consists of developing a client potal enabling the client to monitor his security elements such as servers, databases,etc. . 
This internship included the design of the portal as well as the definition and implementation of the necessary functions.
This consists of 2 parts: FrontEnd developed using Angular, and the BackEnd using Spring Boot. I used an SQL data base to store and manage files and pdf reports,to store users and admins infos, and to allow the Admins to upload clients reports for them to download.
